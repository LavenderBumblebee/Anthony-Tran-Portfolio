# Me as a programmer

## About me 
I started learning programming near the end of 2023 as I felt I need a career change. I did not like what I was doing and 
felt it was about time I started looking towards the opportunities in the future. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Psychology through 
a love for learning about people and understanding what factors help create someone who works more effectively. I believe this does 
set me apart from other candidates.
