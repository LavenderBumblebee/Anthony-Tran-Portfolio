# Me as a programmer- Anthony Tran

## Why I'm doing this 
I started learning programming near the end of 2023 as I felt I need a career change. I did not like what I was doing and 
felt it was about time I started looking towards the opportunities in the future. I felt like this was a pretty darn good switch 
because I use technology alot, and given how much I had used technology I never really took the time to understand how the devices 
I use work. As a result I'm trying to give my all to breaking into the tech field and increase my knowledge on technology. 
### Where I come from 
I graduated with a Bachelor's in Psychology through a love for learning about people and understanding what factors help 
create someone who works more effectively.
